###Summary of the Tutorial
* **The Class Model in TOOL:**
    1. Classes, instances and generic functions:
        * object is an instance of a class
        * every class has its superclass: `<object>`. And you can assign a class's superclass when it's generating.
        * generic-function belongs to the class `<object>`. You can append new method to the generic-function. Each method is specified to a class.
    2. Eval Apply
        * the difference between eval and tool-eval is that the tool-eval has 4 more forms:  
        `define-generic-function` `define-method` `define-class` `make`
        * apply adds a new procedure:  
        `generic-function?`
    3. New Data Structure
        * **class representation:**  
            `class name` `list of slots` `list of ancestors`
        * **generic-function representation**  
            `name of the function` `list of methods defined for it`
        * **method representation**  
            `specializer` `procedure`  
            And the specializer is a list of classes
    4. Definitions:
        1. Defining Generic functions and methods:
            `(define-generic-function name)`   
            *name* is the name of a new generic-function.  In this procedure, this name will be combined to a new generic-function instance. And the instance will be generated by `(make-generic-function name)`.  
            `(define-method generic-function (params-and-classes) . body)`
            *params-and-classes* is a list of param-class pairs.
            
        2. Defining classes and instances:
            * **class**:
                we need to collect all the slots from its ancestor, so there would be a procedure called `collect-slots`
            * **make**:
                This one will be taken care of by the procedure `(make class slots-name-and-values).
                
    5. Applying Generic Function:
        * `apply-generic-function` takes `generic-function` and `arguments` as arguments
        * First it will extract the applicable method from the methods' list which is suitable for the arguments' classes:  
            `compute-applicable-methods-using-classes`
            1. In order to get the most proper method, we will sort it by `method-more-specific`
            2. We also need to check the classes whether they fit in the method by `method-applies-to-classes`. This method bases on:
                1. All the classes **supplied** need to be the exact classes or the **subclasses** of the **required** classes.
                2. There would be no extra classes.
                3. In order to check the ancestor, we will use the "ancestor-link".
                
        * Next when we get the `method`, we will use `tool-apply` upon it:  
            `(tool-apply (method-procedure (car methods)) arguments)`
            
    6. Classes for Scheme Data:  
        TOOL take the original Scheme object as its object. This would be done by keeping the `scheme-object-classes` set.
    7. Initial environment and driver loop  
        At first, the interpreter will bind the `true`, `false` and some initial values.
                


###Answers to Exercises:
* Tutorial Exercise 1:
    1. **Any fault in Louis plan?**  
    If he put the predicate `application?` at the first place, then the program will end in error. Take the `(define x 3)` as an instance:  
    The sentence `(eval (operator exp) env)` will be extended as `(eval 'define env)`, and the eval will explain the `define` as a variable.
    2. If we change every application's form to `call+application`, then we can add a new predicate like `call?` which can specify an application at first. Then it will avoid the error in prob.1
    
* Tutorial Exercise 2:
    1. class definition: `(define-class <vector> <object> xcor ycor)`  
    It's superclass is <object> for there's no direct superclass to it. And it has two slots: xcor and ycor.
    2. methods:  
        * Add method for 2 vectors
        
                (define-method + ((v1 <vector>) (v2 <vector>))
                                  (make <vector>
                                  (xcor (+ (get-slot v1 'xcor) (get-slot v2 'xcor))
                                  (ycor (+ (get-slot v1 'ycor) (get-slot v2 'ycor))
                                  ))))  
        * Mul method for 2 vectors(The inner method is similar)
    
                (define-method * ((v1 <vector>) (v2 <vector>)) ...)
        * Dot method:
        
                (define-method Â· ((v1 <vector>) (v2 <vector>))
                (+ (* (get-slot v1 `xcor) (get-slot v2 `xcor))
                   (* (get-slot v1 `ycor) (get-slot v2 `ycor))
                   ))   
        * `number*vector` & `vector*number`:
    
                (define-method * ((v1 <vector>) (num <number>)))
                (define-method * ((num <number>) (v1 <vector>)))
        * The generic function `length`:
                
                (define-generic-function length)
                (define-method length ((num <number>))
                                        num)
                (define-method length ((vec <vector>))
                                        (make <number>
                                            (sqrt 
                                            (* (get-slot vec 'xcor) 
                                               (get-slot vec 'xcor))
                                            (* (get-slot vec 'ycor)
                                               (get-slot vec 'ycor)))

* Tutorial Exercise 3:
    1. Guess: I think the `paramlist-element-class` will not call the `tool-eval`.  
        A procedure will call it once there's something that the procedure cannot give out the meaning directly. For example, in the line 2 of the `eval-define-method` procedure, it calls the `tool-eval` for the generic function should be explained by the eval procedure.
    2. Real: the tool-eval is called.  
        Here is the code:
        
            (define (paramlist-element-class p env)
              (let ((class (tool-eval (paramlist-element-class-name p) env)))
                (if (class? class)
                    class
                    (error "Unrecognized class -- DEFINE-METHOD >> " class))))
        * `paramlist-element-class-name` is a procedure which analyze the class name of the param. It will pass a quoted variable to the `tool-eval` and it will return the text-part of the quoted variable.  
            * For example, if the quoted one is ``<object>`, then it will return `<object>`.
        * The reason for the `tool-eval`'s appearance, I think, is just to reuse the code. If I don't use `tool-eval`, I could just do `text-of-quotation` to the class, but this is not so general. What's more is that, the `tool-eval` could help us to identify the parameter. If we do `text-of-quotation` to the parameter, without checking out if it's in a quoted form, then it will generate trouble.
        
* Tutorial Exercise 4: Explain how the generic function dispatch the `say` procedure.  
    Take the `(say fluffy 37)` as an example:
    1. Enter the `tool-eval` and explain the `say` as a generic function.
    2. `tool-apply` will do the generic-functions apply.
    3. The class of the two arguments are `<cat>` and `<number>`, for all the methods in the `say`'s methods, the sort method will put the `(say <cat> <number>)` to the first place.

* Tutorial Exercise 5:  
    * First we need to define a generic function `print`
        
            (define-generic-function print)
    * Second, add the method with arguments whose class is `<vector>`:
    
            (define-method print ((v1 <vector>))
               (display (xcor v1))
               (display " ")
               (display (ycor v1)))
